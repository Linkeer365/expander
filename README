OVERVIEW
--------
Expander allows any language to be embadable in other text. Similar to PHP,
it allows for running of arbitrary code in other languages.

For example if we have a ruby file hello.rb:
    puts "HELLO WORLD!"
    <?python
        for i in xrange(5):
            print 'puts "Python is better than Ruby..."'
    ?>

If we run "expander hello.rb", we get:
$ expander hello.rb
puts "HELLO WORLD!"
puts "Python is better than Ruby..."
puts "Python is better than Ruby..."
puts "Python is better than Ruby..."
puts "Python is better than Ruby..."
puts "Python is better than Ruby..."

If we call expander on a directory, all files matching *.exp.* will get
expanded into *.*, and all the code will be executed in the same scope.


LIMITATIONS
-----------
There are a few known limitations:
- Can't use '?>' anywhere in a defined block except as the terminator.
- Python is the only currently supported language.
